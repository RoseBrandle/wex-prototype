This is the code for the [current prototype for Defra's Waste Exemptions service](https://wex-prototype.herokuapp.com/)

Ask a member of the team for login details. It is password-protected to ensure it's not confused with a live government service.

This is in a new location. The [previous version](https://waste-exemptions-renewals.herokuapp.com/) is no longer maintained.
