      <p class='govuk-body'>We are the Environment Agency and we run the Register Your Waste Exemptions service. We are the data controller for this service. A data controller determines how and why personal data (personal information) is processed.</p>
      <p class='govuk-body'>Our <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency/about/personal-information-charter">personal information charter</a> explains your rights and how we deal with your personal information. You can access the charter using the link or go to GOV.UK and search 'Environment Agency personal information charter’.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">The personal data we need</h3>
      <p class='govuk-body'>The personal data we collect about you includes:
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>the name and address of your business or organisation</li>

          <li>the locations of these operations</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class='govuk-body'>We are allowed to process your personal data because we have official authority to register waste exemptions. The lawful basis for processing your personal data is to exercise our official authority that is set out in law.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What we do with your personal data</h3>
      <p class='govuk-body'>We use your personal data in order to process your registration. If you do not provide the information requested, we cannot register your waste exemptions.</p>
      <p class='govuk-body'>We put some of the information from your registration on a public register. This will include the name and address of your business, the type of exempt waste operations being carried out, and the locations of these operations. We will not share or disclose any further personal data to any other party outside the Environment Agency without your explicit consent, unless lawfully able to do so.</p>
      <p class='govuk-body'>We store and process your personal data on our servers within the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>
      <p class='govuk-body'>We do not use your personal data to make an automated decision or for automated profiling.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How long we keep your personal data</h3>
      <p class='govuk-body'>We will keep your personal data for 7 years after a registration has ended. </p>
