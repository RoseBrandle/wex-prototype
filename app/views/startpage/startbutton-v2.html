<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="exemptions">When you need a waste exemption</h2>
<p>A waste exemption is a waste operation that is exempt from needing an environmental permit. Each exemption has limits and conditions that you must comply with.</p>
<p>For guidance on picking the right exemptions, and to check that you meet the exemption conditions, see <a href="#choose">choose the right exemption</a>.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="costs">Exemption costs</h2>
<p>Waste exemptions are free to register, and registration lasts for 3 years.</p>
<p>The exception is the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/waste-exemption-t11-repairing-or-refurbishing-waste-electrical-and-electronic-equipment-weee">T11 WEEE exemption</a>, which covers repairing or refurbishing waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). This costs £1,221 to register for 3 years. To register this exemption, use <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-wex001-registering-exempt-waste-operations">form WEEEX001</a>.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="choose">Choose the right exemptions</h2>

<p>Waste exemptions are listed in 4 categories. Read the guidance to:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>decide which waste exemptions apply to your operations</li>
<li>check you can meet all the limits and conditions</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/waste-exemptions-using-waste">Using waste (exemptions U1 to U16)</a><br />
These cover operations such as using waste in construction, spreading waste materials on the land and burning of waste as fuel.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/waste-exemptions-using-waste">Disposing of waste (exemptions D1 to D8)</a><br />
These cover operations such as depositing sanitary waste, depositing agricultural waste and spoil from dredging inland waters, and burning specific waste in an incinerator or in the open.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/waste-exemptions-storing-waste">Storing waste (exemptions S1 to S3)</a><br />
These cover the storage of certain waste materials in secure containers and at secure sites, and storing sludge.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/waste-exemptions-using-waste">Treating waste (exemptions T1 to T33)</a><br />
These cover operations such as preparing, recovering, sorting and treating certain waste materials, such as waste wood and plant matter.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="farming">Common farming exemptions</h3>
<a href="#">Common farming exemptions</a></p>
<p>This list is an example only and not official advice. You are responsible for selecting the exemptions that are suitable for your waste operation.<br />

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="registerrenew">Register or renew exemptions</h2>
<p>When you have found the right exemption, and are satisfied that your operation meets the limits and conditions, you should register it with us.</p>
<p>Your waste exemption registration will need to be renewed every 3 years, if you are still using it.</p>

<a href="https://wasteexemptions.service.gov.uk" role="button" draggable="false" class="govuk-button govuk-button--start">
  Register or renew
</a>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h3>
<p>You'll need to know:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>the exemptions you want to register (for example, U1 use of waste in construction)</li>
<li>the name, address and contact details of the person, business or organisation carrying out the waste operation</li>
<li>the site address and postcode where the exemption will be used, or a National Grid reference (for example, ST 58132 72695)</li>
<li>for a limited company or limited liability partnership, the company registration number and registered address</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not follow the rules, your waste operation will not be exempt and the Environment Agency will ‘de-register’ your exemption.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="linear">Bulk registrations and linear networks</h2>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Bulk registrations</h3>
<p>If you have more than 30 sites you can register using the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/waste-exemptions-bulk-registration-form">bulk and linear networks registration form</a>.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Linear networks – road, river, canal or railway</h3>
<p>If you want to register U1, U12, D1 or D2 exemptions on a stretch of road, river, canal or railway (a linear network), you should complete the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/waste-exemptions-bulk-registration-form">linear network registration form</a>.</p>
<p>The current online registration system only works for sites that have a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-meaning-of-place-under-the-new-waste-exemption-system">single defined place</a>.</p>
