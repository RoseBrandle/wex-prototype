<p>A waste exemption is a waste operation that is exempt from needing an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-an-environmental-permit">environmental permit</a>. Each exemption has specific limits and conditions you need to operate within. </p>
<p>The exemptions for disposing of waste cover a range of operations, such as burning, depositing and disposing of specific waste materials. These include depositing dredging spoil, disposing of sanitary waste and diseased crops, and burning plant tissue waste, wood packaging and packing material waste. </p>
<p>If you want to operate under a waste exemption you must register that exemption with the Environment Agency. If you donâ€™t, you will not be exempt from needing a permit.
</p>
<p>Registering an exemption does not remove the need to apply for other permits or permissions. For example, you may need planning permission for your waste operation, or a water discharge permit.</p>
