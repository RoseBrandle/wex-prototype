      <p>
A waste exemption is a waste operation that is exempt from needing an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-an-environmental-permit">environmental permit</a>. Each exemption has specific limits and conditions you need to operate within. Each registration lasts 3 years. </p>
<p>The exemptions for using waste cover a range of operations, such as reusing, burning and spreading specific waste materials. These include using waste to produce heat or power, spreading waste on agricultural land, and reusing tyres and end-of-life vehicle parts.</p>
<p>
If you want to operate under a waste exemption you must register that exemption with the Environment Agency. If you donâ€™t, you will not be exempt from needing a permit.</p>
<p>Registering an exemption does not remove the need to apply for other permits or permissions. For example, you may need planning permission for your waste operation, or a water discharge permit.
